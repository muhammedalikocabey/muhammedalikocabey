# Muhammed Ali Kocabey | Android Developer – Kotlin, Architecture, Secure Mobile Systems

I design Android apps using Kotlin, Compose, and modular patterns — with a strong focus on long-term maintainability and security.  
I enjoy writing clean, reusable code that simplifies both development and collaboration.

## About Me

Hi, I'm **Muhammed Ali Kocabey** 
Android developer with 4+ years of hands-on experience, mostly in fintech and enterprise-scale apps. I specialize in Kotlin, secure architecture, and testable modular code.

- Specialized in **Kotlin, Clean Architecture, Modular Systems, Jetpack Compose** (in OSS projects).
- Focused on **secure coding**, **scalable architecture**, and **lifecycle-aware test utilities**.
- Creator of [Aspectify](https://github.com/muhammedalikocabey/aspectify), a small library I built to handle cross-cutting concerns like retries and logging — with minimal boilerplate.
- I write about Android architecture and Kotlin development in both Turkish and English on [Medium](https://medium.com/@muhammedalikocabey).
- Host of [Shaping the Future of Android](https://open.spotify.com/show/7waAQAWmr2WIQNTlTJkkos), I turn selected blog posts into short podcast episodes — sharing real-world tips and reflections from my work in Android development.
- Open to **remote** roles or **relocation**, especially in Europe, the US, or Dubai.



> In my enterprise role at Akbank, I use a **custom declarative UI framework** (not Jetpack Compose), tailored to internal design systems and CI/CD requirements.

## Career Highlights

- Refactored and reused the NFC verification flow in 4+ feature modules, improving testability and SDK integration time.
- Delivered flows like SIM unblocking and admin unlock with encrypted sessions and secure architecture.
- Created reusable UI components (e.g., CalendarSelectable, DoubleOptionView) from scratch.
- Led the migration PoC from RxJava to Coroutines, later standardized across multiple modules.
- Introduced lifecycle-safe coroutine utilities used in 15+ test cases.
- Took initiative in deprecated API replacements (e.g., `onBackPressed`) with modern, high-order solutions.
- Integrated time-critical SDKs (e.g., NFC & Liveness) under production deadlines.

## Current Focus

- Exploring **Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP)** and Compiler Plugin tooling.
- Enhancing legacy enterprise codebases with secure, modular Kotlin architecture.
- Working on better coroutine testing tools and writing about real-world performance issues in UI layers.
